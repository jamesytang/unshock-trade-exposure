Thesis Title: Unshocking a shock - using stock market reactions to measure labor market outcomes from variations in trade exposure  

Abstract: This paper examines the effect of protectionist trade policy, namely the 2018 trade war, and its ability to “unshock” deteriorating labor market outcomes following the establishment of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China in 2000. Using stock market returns to measure county-level trade exposure, I find that, while negatively exposed counties see a sharp rise in unemployment during PNTR, the trade war failed to produce any significant short-term results aimed at reversing these adverse employment trends. These results demonstrate the asymmetry of trade policy outcomes and suggest the potential permanence of trade-related labor displacement.
